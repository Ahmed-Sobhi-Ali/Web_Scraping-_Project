# Cyber Security News Web Scraping Project
This Python project is dedicated to keeping users updated on cyber security news efficiently. It employs web scraping techniques to gather daily cyber security news from various sources and presents them in an HTML file. The primary objective is to streamline the process of accessing relevant cyber security information, ultimately saving users time and effort.

## Importance

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, staying informed about cyber security threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices is crucial. However, manually tracking news from multiple sources can be time-consuming and overwhelming. This project addresses this challenge by automating the process of aggregating cyber security news.

By utilizing web scraping, the project extracts news articles from selected websites, compiles them, and presents them in a structured format. This enables users to conveniently browse through the latest cyber security updates in one centralized location. Moreover, each article includes a direct link to the original source, facilitating further exploration if desired.

## Usage

1. **Scrape News**: Execute the Python script (`scrape_news.py`) to initiate the web scraping process.

2. **View News**: After the script completes execution, access the generated HTML file (`cyber_security_news.html`) to explore the scraped news articles.

## Contribution

Contributions to enhance the functionality, efficiency, or sources of this project are welcome. Whether it's adding support for new websites, improving the scraping algorithm, or optimizing the codebase, contributions from the community can significantly enhance the project's utility.

## Disclaimer

It's important to use this project responsibly and ethically. While web scraping itself is not inherently illegal, it's essential to respect the terms of service of the websites from which data is scraped. Be sure to review and comply with the robots.txt file of each website to ensure adherence to their policies.
